	==> To be discussed .. 


  Spark
  -----

    Spark is an open-source in-memory distributed computing framework.

	-> Spark is written in Scala

	-> Spark is a ployglot  
		-> Spark applications can be written in multiple languages
		-> Supports Python, R, Scala, Java

	-> Spark can run on multiple cluster managers
		-> Supports local, spark standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes

    Spark is a unified framework.
		
	Spark provides a consistent set of APIs for performing different analytics workloads
        using the same execution engine and some well defined data abstractions and operations.

   	Batch Analytics of unstructured data	-> Spark Core API (low-level api)
	Batch Analytics of structured data 	-> Spark SQL
	Streaming Analytics (real time)		-> Spark Streaming (DStreams API), Structured Streaming
	Predictive analytics (ML)		-> Spark MLLib  (mllib & ml)
	Graph parallel computations  		-> Spark GraphX


   Spark Architecture
   ------------------

	1. Cluster Manager (CM)
		-> Applications are submitted to CMs
		-> Allocates containers for lauching driver and executors on the cluster. 
		-> Spark supports multiple CMs
			-> local, standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes		

	2. Driver
		-> Master process
		-> Runs the 'SparkContext' object
		-> Manages the user code and sends the tasks to the executors as per the code. 

		Deploy Modes:
		-> Where to run the driver process
		1. Client : default, driver runs on the client. 
		2. Cluster: driver runs on one of the nodes on the cluster.

	3. SparkContext
		-> Is an application context
		-> Starting point of execution
		-> Is the link between the driver and tasks running on the executors

	4. Executors
		-> Receives the tasks from the Driver
		-> All tasks run the same code but on different partitions of the data
		-> The status of tasks are reported to the driver. 	


   RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
   -----------------------------------
	-> RDD is the fundamental data abstraction of Spark

	-> RDD is a collection of distributed in-memory partitions.
	    -> Each partition is a collection of objects of some type.

	-> RDDs are immutable

	-> RDDs are lazily evaluated
	   -> Transformations does not cause execution.
	   -> Action commands trigger execution.
